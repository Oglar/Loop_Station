# Loop_Station

TO DO:

- Read https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25798200/java-record-mic-to-byte-array-and-play-sound again and understand code
- Create one class for recording and one for playback
- Create Tests (aka: find out how to write them)
- Specify amount of bytes that should be recorded


- How it should work:
There are 3 files than can be created, being written on and being played back via terminal
- if opened, the files should loop
- it should be possible to choose the amount of time being recorded via terminal
- the file can be manipulated via terminal (by inputting 1, 2, or 3 + START STOP or WRITE)

Things to figure out still:

- can I combine 2 Tracks? Best case with asking before recording over it if I want to save the file like that.
- when I finish, can I combine all 3 Tracks to one finished product?
- can I record my Keyboard via Midi input as well?

- Homework: Implement Audio Player as its own class!
